# Introduction.
In this project I have created XML and schema files for basic support ticket application. In this app, the client (the user who submits the ticket) and the support staff (admin) can communicate back and forth to resolve the issue.

## XML and .XSD Scheme

> The **Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is a simple, platform-independent standard for describing data within a structured format. In laymanâ€™s terms, it allows data to be tagged using descriptive names so both humans and computer applications can understand the meaning of different pieces of data.

> One of the most common uses for **schemas** is to verify that an XML document is valid according to a defined set of rules. A schema can be used to validate: 
> - The structure of elements and attributes. For example, a product must have a number and a size, and may optionally have an effDate (effective date). 
> - The order of elements. For example, number must appear before size. 
> - The data values of elements and attributes, based on ranges, enumerations, and pattern matching. For example, size must be an integer between 2 and 18, and effDate must be a valid date. 
> - The uniqueness of values in an instance. For example, all product numbers in an instance must be unique.
